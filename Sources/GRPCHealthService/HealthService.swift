/// ``HealthService`` is gRPC's mechanism for checking whether a server is able to handle RPCs.
/// Its semantics are documented in the [gRPC repository]( https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/5011420f160b91129a7baebe21df9444a07896a6/doc/health-checking.md).
///
/// `HealthService` implements the `grpc.health.v1` service and can be registered with a server
/// like any other service. It holds a ``HealthService/Provider-swift.struct`` which provides
/// status updates to the service. The service doesn't know about the other services running on the
/// server so it must be provided with status updates via the ``Provider-swift.struct``. To make
/// specifying the service being updated easier, the generated code for services includes an
/// extension to `ServiceDescriptor`.
///
/// The following shows an example of initializing a Health service and updating the status of
/// the `Foo` service in the `bar` package.
///
/// ```swift
/// let health = HealthService()
/// try await withGRPCServer(
///   transport: transport,
///   services: [health, FooService()]
/// ) { server in
///   // Update the status of the 'bar.Foo' service.
///   health.provider.updateStatus(.serving, forService: .bar_Foo)
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
